Presenter Notes
===============

Introduction
------------

* Project started in 2006 by Mozilla employee at the time Graydon Hoare.
* Mozilla started spoinsoring in 2009 as they wanted a language better
  suited for build a web browser.
* 1.0 released in 2015

Systems Programming Language
----------------------------

* Improved safety, so correctness and security.
  * NULL pointer issues
  * buffer overflow problems

Runs Blazingly Fast
-------------------

* Zero cost abstractions â€” not that it's free to use but provide higher
  level abstractions that are no more expensive that the the lower level
  alternative.

Prevents Segfaults
------------------

* Tony Hoare (no relation too Graydon) implemented NULL in Algol in 1965 simply
  because it was easy.  He now calls it his billion dollar mistake.

Conditionals: if
----------------

* Here we see a let binding (variable)
* Variables are immutable by default

Functional or Imperative
------------------------

* This is an example of the zerro cost abstractions I mentioned earlier.

Result
------

* No exceptions, Result has a bunch of associated functions to make
  dealing with them ergonomic.

Demo
----

* Implement:
  * Rust
  * Toml
